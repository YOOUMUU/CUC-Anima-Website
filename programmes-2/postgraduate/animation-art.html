            <h2>Research Directions and Contents</h2>
            <p>
              On the one hand, it takes animated art presented in the media of
              film, television, Internet, games, installation art and virtual
              simulation as its object of research; it investigates the form and
              rules of creation of animated art in the context of contemporary
              digital technology; it focuses on the history and reality of
              animation as an independent art; and, through an interdisciplinary
              research path, it places animation under the multiple perspectives
              of aesthetics, culture, philosophy and technology.
