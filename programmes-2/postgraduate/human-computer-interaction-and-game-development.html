            <h2>Areas of Research Focus</h2>
            <p>
              The research focuses on exploring the creation laws, creation
              methods and their technical principles of digital art works such
              as human-computer interaction and game development. It is required
              to carry out research on technical problems in the creation of
              various types of digital art works on the basis of theory and
              practice(such as video games, virtual reality, augmented reality,
              interactive devices, etc.), practice various digital art creation
              concepts and creation styles, and pay close attention to the
              impact of the development of interactive technology and artificial
              intelligence on digital art creation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The research in this direction is characterized by close
              cooperation with the development of animation, games, film and
              television, tracking the latest advances in human-computer
